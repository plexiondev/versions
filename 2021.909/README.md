# plexion.dev
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bbmigohvjmc08wr7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/plexiondev/plexiondev-github-io)


Allowing you to browse through minecraft event datapacks and resourcepacks along with additional extras. The next generation of plexion.dev, since the [rebuild](https://github.com/plexiondev/plexiondev.github.io/commit/2bde6fc2aad26dfc77420b7028e530e3aac0c207) in June.

## What can it do?

The website offers a full [library](https://plexion.dev/library) of minecraft datapacks, resourcepacks and maps that are commonly used in my videos. With the individual projects having their own pages with information on file sizes, last updated + first release dates, compatiability, feature lists, screenshots and more. Pages are generally updated and kept in-sync with my [PlanetMinecraft page](https://planetminecraft.com/member/plexiondev/) on a regular basis - in the event they're not, it's either in the process of updating or I haven't realised (drop an issue if so)

As previewed, short hyperlinks can also be used for many directories. A full writeup hasn't been made but for reference:

* plexion.dev/library/x - **l.plexion.dev/x**, **lib.plexion.dev/x**
* plexion.dev/watch/x - **w.plexion.dev/x**
* plexion.dev/downloads/x - **d.plexion.dev/x**, **dow.plexion.dev/x**

## Dependencies

This project utilises the Github API to power both the [project library](https://plexion.dev/library) and the individual projects themselves as of 2021.720.0 (compiled 20/07/2021). This will mean that an internet connection is required if hosted locally and rate limits/hour can be exceeded and prevent usage of most of the website for periods of time.

Fonts are also imported directly from the Google Fonts API, rather than being locally sourced - **except with the OpenDyslexic font bundled and the previous Ginto Nord font**. In cases where the site is being accessed offline, the page will attempt to load core system fonts such as; Arial, Helvetica, San Francisco and sans-serif.

## Why does this exist?

This was mainly made to learn HTML and CSS by myself. Like I alluded to, I've basically self-taught myself these two languages from scratch and now just work on my website n stuff. You can check out my older attempts over at [plexion.dev/versions](https://plexion.dev/versions) where I've archived **a lot** of builds from my website. If you have any questions, email me or drop an issue!
